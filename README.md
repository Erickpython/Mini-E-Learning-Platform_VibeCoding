# Mini E-Learning Platform â€“ VibeCoding Assignment

This repository contains the source code for my Mini E-Learning Platform prototype, developed as part of the VibeCoding assignment for the "AI for Software Engineering" course.

## Assignment Overview

The objective was to build a simple, clean e-learning platform using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks). Key features include:
- Homepage listing multiple courses
- Course detail pages with descriptions, lessons, and learner progress
- Ability to mark courses as completed
- Optional login/signup functionality with basic front-end validation

## Approach

To streamline development, I leveraged ChatGPT to help craft a detailed prompt, which I then used within Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot. This enabled efficient prototyping and ensured best practices in code structure and design.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub Copilot
- ChatGPT (for prompt engineering)

## Deployment

This project is deployed on Netlify and can be accessed through this link:

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the platform.
